# Bankers Algorithm in C

# Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the Banker's Algorithm in C. The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm designed for multi-user systems. It ensures that a system remains in a safe state by dynamically checking the resource allocation and requests to avoid deadlock.

# Features

 Resource allocation and request handling.
 Safe state checking to prevent deadlock.
 Support for multiple processes and resources.
 Implementation of both allocation and release of resources.

# Requirements

C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
Standard C library
